# TEAM_012: Android Development Toolchain Enhancement

## Mission
Add Kotlin, Scala, and Maven to complete the Android/JVM development toolchain.

- Existing: Android SDK, Gradle, scrcpy, platform-tools

## Plan
1. [x] Register team
2. [x] Create install-kotlin.sh (Kotlin compiler + tools)
3. [x] Create install-scala.sh (Scala + sbt)
4. [x] Create install-maven.sh (Maven build tool)
5. [x] Update android.yml to include new scripts
6. [x] Final verification

## Progress
- Started: 2025-12-29
- Completed: 2025-12-29

## Notes
- Kotlin is essential for modern Android development
- Scala requested by user
- Maven provides alternative to Gradle for some projects
